Calendar Klaxon delivers unmissable calendar alerts for people who need them.

Standard notifications are easy to ignore. When you're deep in work, a gentle banner disappears before you notice it. Calendar Klaxon takes a different approach: it displays a blocking window that appears above everything, including fullscreen apps, and plays a configurable alarm sound to get your attention. It's not rude, it's reliable.

**FEATURES**

• Blocking Alerts
Alerts appear above all windows, including fullscreen video calls, presentations, and games.

• Customizable Warnings
Set up to 4 different warning times before each event. Get alerts at 15 minutes, 5 minutes, 1 minute, or whatever timing works for you.

• Multiple Alert Sounds
Choose from 10 different sounds including alarms, bells, and air horns. Set different sounds for different warning stages, or use silent mode.

• Calendar Filtering
Select which calendars to monitor. Keep work alerts on while silencing personal calendars, or vice versa.

• Do Not Disturb
Respects your system's Focus modes. When Do Not Disturb is on, Calendar Klaxon stays quiet.

• Event Details
Each alert shows the event title, time remaining, start time, location, and event URL.

• Quick Actions
Press Escape to dismiss, or Enter to open the event directly in Calendar.

• Launch at Login
Start automatically when you log in.

• Menu Bar Native
Runs quietly in your menu bar with no dock icon.

**ACCESSIBILITY**

Designed as an assistive utility for people with ADHD, time blindness, or anyone who gets absorbed in their work and needs an unmissable reminder.  Full voice over & voice command support for the visually impaired or anyone who'd rather talk to their computer. 

**PRIVACY**

Calendar Klaxon reads your calendar data locally to display alerts. No data is collected or transmitted. Your calendar stays on your Mac.
