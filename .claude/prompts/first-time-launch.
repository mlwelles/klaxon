Make it so the app 
   - on first time launch
   - before it checks ro or requests calendar access
Pops up a model that:
   - Shows the logo and title of the app.
   - Explains that it is going to request access to the calendar
   - and explains why it needs it.
   - And has an "OK" button that will dismiss.


Modify the about window, so that
  - instead of "Created by michael l. welles" and an email credit at the bottom
  - On the top under the icon, it shows "(C) {year} Michael L. Welles  <a href=https://github.com/mlwelles>(@mlwelles)</a>.
  - and in a line under that "Released under the terms of the <a href=[LINK TO LICENCE.MD IN UPSTREAM REP>MIT License</a> as open source."
