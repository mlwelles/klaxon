Modify the about window, so that
  - instead of "Created by michael l. welles" and an email credit at the bottom
  - On the top under the icon, it shows "(C) {year} Michael L. Welles  <a href=https://github.com/mlwelles>(@mlwelles)</a>.
  - and in a line under that "Released under the terms of the <a href=[LINK TO LICENCE.MD IN UPSTREAM REP>MIT License</a> as open source."
