# Privacy Policy for Calendar Klaxon

**Last updated:** January 21, 2026

## Overview

Calendar Klaxon is a macOS menu bar application that monitors your calendar and displays alerts when events are about to start. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how Calendar Klaxon handles your data.

## Data Collection

**Calendar Klaxon does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

### What the app accesses locally:

- **Calendar Data**: The app reads your calendar events using Apple's EventKit framework to determine when to show alerts. This data is accessed locally on your device and is never transmitted anywhere.

- **User Preferences**: Your app preferences (alert sounds, timing, enabled calendars) are stored locally on your device using macOS's standard UserDefaults system.

### What the app does NOT do:

- Does not collect analytics or usage data
- Does not use tracking technologies
- Does not transmit any data over the internet
- Does not share data with third parties
- Does not store calendar data beyond what's needed for immediate alert display

## Permissions

Calendar Klaxon requires calendar access permission to function. This permission is used solely to read event information for displaying alerts. You can revoke this permission at any time in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Calendars.

## Third-Party Services

Calendar Klaxon does not integrate with any third-party services or APIs.

## Children's Privacy

Calendar Klaxon does not knowingly collect any information from children.
